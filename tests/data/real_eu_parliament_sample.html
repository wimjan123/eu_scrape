        <p class="contents">
            García Pérez (PPE). – Madam President, I rise to speak about the urgent need to address human rights violations in several regions worldwide.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            The situation in Myanmar remains deeply concerning. Since the military coup in 2021, we have witnessed systematic violations of fundamental rights. The international community must take decisive action.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            Müller, Hans (S&D). – Thank you, Madam President. I would like to associate myself with the previous speaker's remarks.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            However, I believe we must also focus on the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. The Taliban's restrictions on women's rights represent a clear violation of international law.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            President. – I would like to remind speakers that we have limited time for this debate.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            Rossi, Maria (GUE/NGL). – Madam President, while we debate human rights abroad, we must also address issues within our own borders.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            The treatment of migrants at European borders raises serious concerns about our commitment to human dignity. We cannot have double standards.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            Johnson, David (Renew). – Thank you, Madam President. I appreciate the contributions from my colleagues.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            The European Union has always been a champion of human rights, both within and beyond our borders. We must continue this tradition through concrete actions, not just words.
        </p>

            President. – The debate is closed. We will now proceed to the vote.

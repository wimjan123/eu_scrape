            President. – The next item is the debate on the economic and social situation.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            Commissioner Vestager. – Madam President, honourable Members, thank you for this opportunity to present the Commission's assessment of the current economic situation.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            The European economy is showing signs of resilience despite global uncertainties. GDP growth in the third quarter exceeded expectations at 2.1%, driven primarily by domestic consumption and investment.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            However, we must remain vigilant. Inflation, while decreasing, remains above our target of 2%. The ECB's monetary policy continues to play a crucial role in maintaining price stability.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            Schmidt, Andreas (PPE). – Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for this comprehensive overview.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            While the figures are indeed encouraging, we must not forget the challenges faced by small and medium enterprises across Europe. Access to credit remains difficult, particularly for innovative startups in the technology sector.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            Dubois, Marie (S&D). – Thank you, Madam President. Commissioner Vestager, while I appreciate the positive economic indicators, we cannot ignore the social dimension.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            Youth unemployment in several Member States remains unacceptably high. In Spain and Italy, over 20% of young people are without work. This is not just an economic issue; it's a social crisis that threatens the future of an entire generation.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            Van der Berg, Willem (Renew). – Madam President, I would like to focus on the digital transition aspect of our economic recovery.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            The Commission's Digital Decade programme aims to have 80% of Europeans with digital skills by 2030. However, current progress suggests we will fall short of this target. What concrete measures will the Commission take to accelerate digital education?
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            Kowalski, Piotr (ECR). – Madam President, while my colleagues focus on statistics and programmes, I want to speak about real people and real problems.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            In my constituency in Poland, families are struggling with energy costs that have tripled in two years. The Green Deal is important, but we cannot implement it on the backs of working families who can barely afford to heat their homes.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            Virtanen, Elina (Greens/EFA). – Madam President, I strongly disagree with the previous speaker. The climate crisis is not something we can postpone.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            The recent floods in Central Europe and droughts in Southern Europe cost our economies billions of euros. Investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency is not just environmentally necessary; it's economically smart.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            President. – I must remind all speakers to respect the speaking time limits.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            Lefèvre, Jean-Claude (GUE/NGL). – Madam President, this debate once again reveals the fundamental contradictions of capitalism.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            We celebrate GDP growth while millions of Europeans live in poverty. We praise technological innovation while workers lose their jobs to automation. It's time for a fundamental rethinking of our economic model.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            Bianchi, Giuseppe (ID). – Madam President, the previous speaker talks about contradictions, but the real contradiction is our immigration policy.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            How can we provide jobs for our citizens when millions of irregular migrants compete for the same positions? How can we maintain our social systems when they are overwhelmed by unprecedented migration flows?
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            President. – I remind the honourable Member to stay within the scope of today's debate.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            Commissioner Vestager. – Madam President, I would like to respond to the various points raised by honourable Members.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            Regarding SME access to credit, the Commission is working with the European Investment Bank to expand guarantee schemes. We expect to announce new measures within the coming months.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            On youth unemployment, Mr Dubois is absolutely right that this requires urgent attention. The enhanced Youth Guarantee programme has already helped 1.2 million young Europeans find employment or training opportunities.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            President. – The debate is concluded. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00.
        </p>
        
        <p class="contents">
            (The sitting was suspended at 13.45 and resumed at 15.00)

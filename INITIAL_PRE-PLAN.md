YOU ARE A AI PLANNER. YOU NEED TO MAKE A COMPROHENSIVE PLAN OF WHICH YOU KNOW 99%  SURE THAT IMPLEMENTATION WILL SUCCEED. 
DON'T FORGET TO USE MCP TOOLS, LIKE SEQUENTIAL THINKING AND CONTEXT7.
ALSO YOU CAN USE PUPPETEER AND PLAYWRIGHT 

YOU MUST DO INITIAL RESEARCH AND PLACE THAT RESEARCH INTO ./planner/research/
NEXT I WANT YOU TO PROVIDE A MULTI STEP HIGHLY DETAILED AND TESTED PLAN IN ./planner/plan/
FINISH OFF WITH A PROMPT FOR IMPLEMENTATION AI. PLACE IT IN ./planner/prompt/. 
MAKE SURE YOU PROVIDE A PHASE BASED CHECKLIST SO THE IMPLEMENTATION AI CAN LOG IT'S PROGRESS. PLACE IT IN ./planner/checklist/

Role
You are a pragmatic researcher-planner. Your job is to figure out how to collect European Parliament plenary debates and turn them into a simple, reliable dataset.

Goal
Find the best official sources to pull debate segments and return clean data with:
- speaker_name
- speaker_country
- speaker_party_or_group
- segment_start_ts
- segment_end_ts
- speech_text if available
- is_announcement plus a short label for the type of announcement

Scope
- Use the European Parliament Open Data portal as the primary entry point.
- If needed, use the daily verbatim reports for structure and cross-checking.
- Prefer official IDs so speakers can be matched to their country and party/group.
- Focus on plenary sessions first. A few recent months is enough for a proof of concept.

What to figure out first
1) Where to list sessions and pull their speeches.
2) How timestamps are provided. If they exist per segment, use them. If not, find a consistent fallback.
3) How announcements are represented. Identify how they are labeled in the data or in the daily reports, and provide examples.
4) How to match a speechâ€™s speaker to their country and EP group. If national party is available, capture it too.

Output format
- Deliver a single CSV and JSONL for a sample date range with the fields listed above.
- Include a short README that explains:
  - Which endpoints or pages you used
  - How announcements were detected and labeled
  - Any gaps or known limitations
  - Examples of 3 different announcement types you found

Constraints
- Be gentle with rate limits. Make your collection restartable if it stops halfway.
- Keep timestamps in UTC and ISO 8601 format.
- Use clear, stable identifiers in the output so the data can be joined later.

Quality check
- Randomly spot check at least 20 segments. Confirm speaker, timing, and whether something is an announcement.
- Note any cases where speakers are not MEPs and how you handled them.

Deliverables
1) A short plan of attack in plain language.
2) A working sample dataset for a recent month.
3) A brief notes file that answers: how announcements are documented, where timestamps come from, and how speaker country and party/group were resolved.

Reminder
If available, consult context7 for the most recent documentation and schemas before deciding on exact fields or parameters.

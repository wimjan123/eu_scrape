# EU Parliament Data Sources Research Report

## üìã Executive Summary

This research identifies the optimal data sources and collection strategies for extracting European Parliament plenary debate data with the required fields: speaker_name, speaker_country, speaker_party_or_group, segment_start_ts, segment_end_ts, speech_text, is_announcement, and announcement_label.

**Primary Finding**: A hybrid approach combining official APIs with structured web scraping will be required to obtain all target data fields with sufficient quality and granularity.

## üîç Timestamp Analysis

### Current State
**Challenge**: No single source provides speech-segment level timestamps in a structured format.

**Available Timing Information**:
1. **Session-level**: Start/end times for entire plenary sessions
2. **Agenda-item level**: Timing for major debate topics
3. **Video metadata**: Potential timing information from multimedia content
4. **Procedural markers**: Time references in verbatim reports (e.g., "14:30 - The sitting opened")

### Recommended Approach
**Hybrid Timing Strategy**:
1. Extract session and agenda-item timestamps from official sources
2. Parse time references from verbatim report text
3. Use video metadata where available as validation
4. Implement fallback estimation based on speech length and session duration

**Implementation Priority**:
- Phase 1: Session and agenda-item level timing
- Phase 2: Speech-segment estimation from text analysis
- Phase 3: Video metadata integration (if feasible)

## üì¢ Announcement Detection Strategy

### Announcement Types Identified
1. **Session Management**: Opening/closing, breaks, procedural issues
2. **Agenda Items**: Introduction of new topics, transitions
3. **Voting Procedures**: Vote announcements, results
4. **Procedural Notices**: Rule clarifications, technical issues
5. **General Announcements**: Administrative communications

### Detection Patterns
**Role-based Detection**:
- Speaker roles: President, Vice-President, Secretary-General
- Procedural titles and formal language patterns

**Content-based Detection**:
```
Linguistic Patterns:
- "The sitting is opened/closed"
- "Next item on the agenda"
- "Voting time"
- "I call upon..."
- "The debate is closed"
- "Procedures without debate"
- "Written statements"

Structural Patterns:
- Short segments (< 50 words)
- Formal language register
- Procedural vocabulary
- Time references
```

**Context-based Detection**:
- Position in session structure
- Surrounding content analysis
- Speaker role correlation

## üë• Speaker Resolution Strategy

### MEP Speaker Resolution
**Primary Method**: Direct matching against MEP database
- Full name matching with fuzzy logic for variations
- Temporal validation for group affiliations
- Country assignment based on representation

**Fallback Methods**:
- Partial name matching with confidence scoring
- Role-based inference (e.g., "President" ‚Üí current EP President)
- Context clues from speech content

### Non-MEP Speaker Handling
**Categories**:
- European Council representatives
- European Commission officials
- Guest speakers and experts
- National government representatives

**Resolution Strategy**:
- Maintain separate database of institutional roles
- Extract title/role information from speech context
- Manual verification for high-profile speakers
- Clear flagging of unresolved speakers

## ‚ö° Technical Implementation Approach

### Data Collection Pipeline
```
Phase 1: Discovery
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Session catalog from Open Data Portal

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Metadata collection and validation

Phase 2: Content Collection
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Verbatim report download (XML/HTML)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MEP database synchronization
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Session structure parsing

Phase 3: Processing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Speech segment extraction
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Speaker resolution and enrichment
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Timestamp estimation and validation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Announcement classification
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Data quality validation

Phase 4: Output

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Documentation generation
```

### Rate Limiting Strategy

- EUR-Lex SPARQL: 1 query per 2 seconds
- Verbatim reports: 1 document per 3 seconds
- MEP database: 1 request per 1 second

**Error Handling**:
- Exponential backoff on failures

- Request logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation on partial failures
